      <h2>Update (23.10.2023):</h2>
      <br>
      <p><strong>I've had this check in place and it didn't work lol</strong></p><br>
      <p>At least the bill was only 30â‚¬ but it changed my perspective.</p><br>
      <p>The issue was that the pubsub topic wasn't triggered. I don't know why, in testing it worked.
        It might have to do with the way the resource calculated the cost but I don't care any more.
        I've come to the conclusion that the only way to keep costs in check is to know wtf you are doing
        when setting up resources. This is a shitty way but as long as google doesn't implement an off-switch
        for billing this is the best/only way. I hate it but i'll live with it.</p>
      </div>
      <br />
      Run a <strong>cloud function</strong> that <strong
        >stops all billing</strong
      > when costs exceed the budget.
